This Django project automates the creation of professional financial reports for the fixed income market. The process starts with data extraction from market sources, which is then stored in a database. Python scripts manage the business logic, including calculations, validations, and data structuring. Once processed, the information is passed to HTML templates carefully designed for clarity and aesthetics, using Djangoâ€™s template engine to dynamically inject the latest market data. The templates are then converted into a PDF format that preserves the visual style and layout while ensuring accuracy of the financial figures. The system is fully dynamic, meaning that each time new data is inserted into the database, the PDF is generated with updated market insights. This includes details on corporate debt activity, TES performance, and primary market transactions. The architecture ensures a clean separation between data handling, business logic, and presentation, making the solution scalable, maintainable, and adaptable for a wide range of financial reporting needs.
